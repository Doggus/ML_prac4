Hi there, I really struggled and eventually couldn't find a way to determine a perceptron for XOR that did't use any of the forbidden algorithms and that worked. But I knew that 'XOR' is equal to 'OR' - 'AND' so what I did was find the perceptrons for 'OR' and 'AND' and then used their weights to determine a perceptron for XOR.

The 'OR' perceptron caused 3 inequalities before converging
The 'AND' perceptron caused 0 inequalities before converging
So technically, it took the 'XOR' perceptron 3 inequalities before converging

I hope this ok as I truly couldnt think of any other method to do so. Thanks and have a great day.
